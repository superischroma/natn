                "Indians" used to refer to Native Americans has a long history.
                The word is "generally attributed to Christopher Columbus, who,
                mistakenly believing he had reached the Indies, named the indigenous
                peoples he encountered Indios" (ABC-CLIO). I believe that the trait
                of giving foreigners a unique name for you and your people runs
                through Europe, and that the English gave the tribes easier names
                because that is what everyone else did. They might've thought it
                was a normal thing to do and they never bothered to even inquire
                the natives of what their actual names were.

            <div class="header">Sioux Name Controversy</div>
            <div class="text-region" style="width: 80%; font-size: 24px;">
                Most Native American tribes were completely complicit with the
                alternate names that the English gave them. However, some name
                changes can be "undesirable or difficult to [have] effect...[m]any members
                of these tribes and bands prefer the ethnonyms Lakota, Dakota, and
                Nakota (for the three dialects of their language), because Sioux is
                a derivation of Nadouessioux—meaning "Adder" or "Snake"; another name
                bestowed courtesy of traditional rivals" (Britannica School). Name
                changes by the settlers can sometimes be ignorant and cause easily
                avoidable disturbances. Blatantly assuming that a group will be fine
                with a name can cause serious issues, like what happened with the Sioux
                tribes. Despite that, early American settlers did not take this into
                consideration, and ended up negatively engaging in the general activities
                of the natives.

                Around the time of the American Revolution, "portrayals of Native Americans
                appeared as "noble savages," or "uncivilized," frequently noted by their
                clothing and demeanor." It's clear to see that Native Americans have been treated
                as less-than for a long time. Europeans' unwillingness to talk to people
                that believe are less than them probably lead to the disrespectful and
                otherwise seemingly pointless name changes they gave the natives when
                they settled in America.<br><br>To the right of this text, you can see Tecumseh.
                Native Americans are generally portrayed as simple, weak, and careless by the
                English. However, Tecumseh was not a normal Native American according to the
                person who illustrated him. He is portrayed here as a strong, tidy man who is
                wearing what almost looks like a suit. The reason he was looked at in such a
                positive way was because he served the English, not a Native American tribe.
                Therefore, the English looked at him under a different light and illustrated him
                more closely to one of their own. The English show clear bias against people who
                they dislike. If you're favored by them, you are portrayed in illustrations and
                documents much better than those who angered them.

            <div class="text-region" style="width: 80%; font-size: 22px;">
                The renaming of native tribes in America has always been a thought-provoking subject.
                Some names of the tribes were even barely changed by the English, seemingly making
                altercations for no apparent reason. However, after taking a look back at history and
                seeing what occurred leading up to these name changes makes it very clear why it was done.
                Native tribe names were changed in order to make English peoples' lives easier, and to
                assert the fact that they were in control of the natives. They didn't care what the groups
                thought of the name change, so they ended up causing controversy within some groups. But
                it's not only the English; Naming foreign groups based on personal preference is part of
                European culture, as seen with Columbus. And despite the poor treatment of the tribes as
                a whole, cases like Tecumseh are provided to the general public as a common act back in
                the day. It is truly the thirst for superiority in the English that makes alternate names
                among the Native American tribes such a big deal, and why we still talk about it today.
